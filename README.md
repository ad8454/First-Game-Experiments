Two old games I made with Swing when I was just starting out learning Java.

**Space Invaders** is meant to be an arcade style space shooter game where the objective is to dodge and shoot asteroids
before the time runs out.

The second one, **Snake**, is reminiscent of the old Nokia game and includes power ups that let your snake go though walls!
